This 3 server web infrasructure design illustrates how a client gets the webpage of www.foobar.com. I added the load balancer(HAproxy) which serves to distribute the traffic going to the server using the least connection first scheduling algorithm. This helps to load the incoming traffic on the server with the least amount of request as the servers are of equal capacity. The load balancer uses active-passive method. 2 out of the 3 servers are actively working while the third server is reserved incase of one of the server's downtime. 
Ifthe load balancer happens to breakdown, whole web infrastructure will be down. This is the SPOF. The HTTP requests and response are not sent over SSL certificate. This can serve as security issue between information being passed between the client and the servers. Lack of monitoring client is also a disadvantage in situation were the the user experience is really not desirable or in the case of a server being overwhelmed with requests.
